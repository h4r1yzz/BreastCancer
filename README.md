# Breast Cancer Prediction Project üéóÔ∏è
## Overview üîç

This project focuses on building a **machine learning model** to predict whether a breast tumor is **malignant (cancerous)** or **benign (non-cancerous)** based on features extracted from digitized images of fine needle aspirates (FNA) of breast masses. The dataset used in this project is the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset**, which is publicly available from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic)).

The goal of this project is to:

1. **Preprocess and explore the dataset**.
2. **Train and evaluate various machine learning models**.
3. **Deploy the best-performing model for predictions**.

This repository contains the code, datasets, and documentation necessary to replicate the project.

## Dataset üìä

The dataset used in this project is the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset**. It contains **569 instances** with **30 features** each, computed from digitized images of breast mass FNA. The features describe characteristics of the cell nuclei, such as:

- **Radius**
- **Texture**
- **Perimeter**
- **Area**
- **Smoothness**
- **Compactness**
- **Concavity**
- **Symmetry**
- **Fractal Dimension**

**Target Variable**: `diagnosis` (M = Malignant, B = Benign)  
**Features**: 30 numeric attributes derived from the images.

The dataset is included in the `data/` directory as `data.csv`.

## Deployment on AWS EC2 with Docker
This section provides step-by-step instructions for deploying the machine learning model on an AWS EC2 instance using Docker.

Prerequisites
AWS Account: You need an AWS account to create an EC2 instance.

Docker: Install Docker on your local machine and the EC2 instance.

AWS CLI: Install and configure the AWS CLI on your local machine.

Steps
1. Create an EC2 Instance
Log in to the AWS Management Console.

Navigate to EC2 and click Launch Instance.

Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) with Docker pre-installed (e.g., Amazon Linux 2).

Select an instance type (e.g., t2.micro for free tier).

Configure security groups to allow inbound traffic on port 5000 (for the Flask app).

Launch the instance and download the key pair (.pem file).

2. Connect to the EC2 Instance
Use SSH to connect to your EC2 instance:
```
ssh -i /path/to/your-key.pem ec2-user@<public-ip-address>
```
3. Install Docker on EC2 (if not pre-installed)
```
sudo yum update -y
sudo yum install docker -y
sudo service docker start
sudo usermod -a -G docker ec2-user
```
4. Build and Run the Docker Container
Copy the project files to the EC2 instance using scp:
```
scp -i /path/to/your-key.pem -r /path/to/breast-cancer-ml-project ec2-user@<public-ip-address>:~/
```
SSH into the EC2 instance and navigate to the project directory:
```
cd breast-cancer-ml-project
```
Build the Docker image:
```
docker build -t breast-cancer-ml .
```
Run the Docker container:
```
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 breast-cancer-ml
```
5. Access the Deployed Model
The Flask app will be running on port 8501.

Open a browser and navigate to http://<public-ip-address>:8501 to access the application.
