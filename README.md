# Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict whether a breast tumor is malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous) based on features extracted from digitized images of fine needle aspirates (FNA) of breast masses. The dataset used in this project is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset, which is publicly available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

The goal of this project is to:

1. Preprocess and explore the dataset.

2. Train and evaluate various machine learning models.

3. Deploy the best-performing model for predictions.

This repository contains the code, datasets, and documentation necessary to replicate the project.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset. It contains 569 instances with 30 features each, computed from digitized images of breast mass FNA. The features describe characteristics of the cell nuclei, such as radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness, concavity, symmetry, and fractal dimension.

Target Variable: diagnosis (M = Malignant, B = Benign)

Features: 30 numeric attributes derived from the images.

The dataset is included in the data/ directory as breast_cancer.csv.
